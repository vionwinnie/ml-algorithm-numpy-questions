How to implement basic ML Algorithm using numpy matrix operations 

I added K-means, K Nearest Neighbor, Linear Regression as examples. Please contact me if you have ideas on how to improve the question set!

I created these exploratory data questions using Gemini 2.0-flash. I have to correct the implementation a few times as the answer prefers using for-loop than matrix operations.
